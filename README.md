# VisiOS

Welcome to the VisiOS GitHub repository! VisiOS is a virtual operating system created on TurboWarp that offers a playful and creative alternative to traditional operating systems. This repository contains the alpha versions of VisiOS.

We also have a website - https://barney86.neocities.org/visios/

## Downloads

You can download the alpha versions of VisiOS from the [Downloads](https://barney86.neocities.org/visios/downloads.html) page on the VisiOS website, or using TurboWarp online.

## Features

The alpha versions of VisiOS are really limited by current time (not even having the brand new programming language we haven't done yet), but currently we have: 
* A ustomizable desktop environment
* Two 100% Pencil rendered windows (but they can be unlimited)
* And more coming soon!
